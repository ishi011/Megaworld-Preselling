                The Metro Manila Subway is a 33.1km underground rail project
                currently being built in Metro Manila, Philippines, linking
                Valenzuela with Ninoy Aquino International Airport through 17
                stations and a depot. As the nation's first underground mass
                transit system, it is designed to handle up to 1.5 million
                passengers daily, with an initial capacity of 400,000 to 800,000
                passengers. Initiated by the Department of Transportation (DOTr)
                and approved by the National Economic Development Authority
                (NEDA), the project is part of the Duterte Administration's
                Build, Build, Build initiative. The subway’s groundbreaking
                occurred in February 2019, with phase one expected to be
                finished by 2025 and the entire project slated for completion by
                July 2027.

                The Kalayaan Bridge also known as the BGC-Ortigas Link Bridge,
                was complete on June 12, 2021. Lawton Avenue and Kapitolyo are
                connected by this four-lane, two-way bridge that traverses the
                Pasig River. Its primary objective is to reduce the travel time
                between Fort Bonifacio and Ortigas to a mere 12 minutes by
                alleviating traffic congestion on main roadways such as EDSA and
                C-5. The bridge not only alleviates traffic congestion but also
                improves connectivity between critical business districts,
                thereby stimulating economic growth and development in the
                surrounding region. The enhanced accessibility has also made it
                more convenient for residents and commuters, contributing to a
                more efficient transportation network in Metro Manila.

                The expansion of Lawton Avenue, which is part of the
                infrastructure improvements in Bonifacio Global City (BGC), has
                indeed been a significant development. This project expanded the
                road from four lanes to six lanes, covering the stretch from 5th
                Avenue to Bayani Road. This widening project has notably eased
                traffic congestion along major thoroughfares such as EDSA, South
                Superhighway, and C-5 Road. Additionally, it has reduced the
                travel time from Bonifacio Global City to Ninoy Aquino
                International Airport to approximately 15 minutes12. This
                expansion is part of a broader effort to improve connectivity
                and accessibility within the area, complementing other
                infrastructure projects like the Kalayaan Bridge

                infrastructure and vibrant business environment. Designed with
                historical importance but also modernity, it becomes a landmark
                for good governance. It stands surrounded by high-end housing
                estates as well as places of culture, signalling our country’s
                aim to be modernizing and progressive. The establishment of this
